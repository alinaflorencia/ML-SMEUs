# ML-SMEUs

## This is the repository of SMEUs Machine Learning Team. 
### We made a classification of goods based on city, general_category, price range, and ratings. Furthermore, we also made algorithm for similarity SMEs using scikit-learn (cosine similarity).
### Here's the tools that we used for making a model:
### • Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook
### • TensorFlow
### • Google Sheets
### • Matplotlib
### • Numpy
### • Pandas
### • Scikit-learn <br>
<br>

### Below are the steps to run the project:
### • Clone the project from repository
### • Run Classification_Goods.ipynb on Jupyter Notebooks or Google Colab to create model and save the model as tf.lite
### • Run Cosine_Similarity_for_Similarity_UMKM.ipynb on Jupyter or Colab  to get the name similarity dataset between SMEs <br>
